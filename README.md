# YouTube-API-Pipeline
The project is created as a learning experience and implement a basic data pipeline on a virtual machine in GCP. 
The pipeline will run once a day on a virtual machine, processed by DAG tasks, and stored in GCP's Cloud Storage. 
The data will also stored in PostgreSQL for querying.

A future improvement is visualizing the data through GCP's Looker Studio.
